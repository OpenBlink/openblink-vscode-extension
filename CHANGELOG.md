# Changelog

All notable changes to the OpenBlink VSCode Extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- Include `bluetooth-hci-socket` native binding in Linux VSIX for HCI socket BLE support
- Include noble's `with-custom-binding.js` in VSIX for correct native binding resolution

### Changed
- Improve CI workflows and VSIX packaging reliability
- Quote `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` in release workflow to avoid word-splitting

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **Platform-specific VSIX builds** — Release pipeline now produces separate VSIX files per platform (`darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `win32-x64`, `linux-x64`) following [VS Code official guidance](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#platformspecific-extensions), ensuring correct native BLE bindings are included for each OS
- **3-job release pipeline** — Restructured `release.yml` into `build-wasm` → `build` (matrix ×4) → `publish` stages
- **GitHub Release** — All platform-specific VSIX files are attached to each release

### Fixed
- Skip native binding verification on Linux (noble uses pure JS HCI socket, no `binding.node`)
- Open VSX publish loop now attempts all platforms even if one fails
- Pin `npx` tool versions (`@vscode/vsce@3`, `ovsx@0`) for reproducible CI builds
- Add top-level `permissions: contents: read` to release workflow (least privilege)
- Include `debug` and `ms` in VSIX (runtime dependencies of `@abandonware/noble`)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **MCP Integration** — Built-in Model Context Protocol server with 5 AI agent tools (`build_and_blink`, `get_device_info`, `get_console_output`, `get_metrics`, `get_board_reference`), supporting Windsurf Cascade, VS Code Copilot, Cursor, and Cline
- **MCP Status TreeView** — Dedicated sidebar view showing MCP connection activity and build results
- **Cascade Hook** — `post_write_code` hook auto-triggers Build & Blink when `.rb` files are edited by Windsurf Cascade
- **Console ring buffer** — In-memory ring buffer for device console output, accessible via MCP
- **Board configurations** — Built-in support for Generic (mruby/c standard library), M5 Stamp S3, and XIAO nRF54L15
- **Internationalization** — Multi-language UI support for English, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese via `@vscode/l10n`
- **CI/CD workflows** — GitHub Actions for CI (lint + build + test on 3 OS × 2 Node versions), WASM build, and release automation
- **Comprehensive documentation** — Architecture, BLE protocol, build system, compiler, board configuration, i18n, and contributing guides
- **BLE device management** — Dedicated Devices TreeView with scan/stop buttons, real-time discovery, connection animations, saved-device persistence, and auto-reconnect
- **Metrics TreeView** — Compile time, transfer time, and program size with min/avg/max statistics
- **Board Reference TreeView** — Per-board API reference displayed in the sidebar
- **`openblink.setupMcp` command** — Generates MCP configuration snippets for supported AI coding assistants

### Changed
- **Full modular rewrite** — Monolithic extension refactored into 7 focused modules (`extension.ts`, `compiler.ts`, `ble-manager.ts`, `protocol.ts`, `board-manager.ts`, `ui-manager.ts`, `types.ts`) plus MCP modules (`mcp-bridge.ts`, `mcp-server.ts`)
- **Webpack dual-entry build** — Separate bundles for the extension and the standalone MCP server
- **Refined auto-build on save** — Build & Blink on save now only triggers for manual saves of the focused `.rb` file (ignores auto-save and background saves)
- **Exclusive build control** — Concurrent build requests are serialized to prevent race conditions

### Fixed
- Strip trailing newlines from BLE console output
- Security, stability, and input validation improvements across all modules
- Dependency vulnerability fixes (`copy-webpack-plugin` v14, ESLint v10, TypeScript v6)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-06

### Added
- Ability to select target `.rb` files for building
- Condition "when Ruby source file is open" for file transfer on save

## [0.1.5] - 2025-03-27

### Fixed
- CRC calculation method corrected

### Note
- Final test version before 0.2.0

## [0.1.4] - 2025-03-25

### Changed
- Safe dependency configuration

## [0.1.1] - 2025-03-20

### Added
- Initial release with basic Build & Blink functionality over BLE
